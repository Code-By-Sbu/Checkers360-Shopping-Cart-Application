# Checkers360-Shopping-Cart-Application
This project is a Python console application designed to simulate a shopping cart system for the Checkers360 app. It allows users to add items, view cart contents, calculate totals, and manage purchases efficiently through a simple, interactive interface.
Features:

Add Items to Cart: Users can input item names, prices, and quantities. If an item already exists, its quantity is updated automatically.

View Cart Contents: Displays each item along with its price, quantity, and total cost per item, providing a clear overview of the cart.

Calculate Total Cart Value: Computes and displays the total value of all items in the cart.

Menu-Driven Interaction: Users can choose to add items, view the cart, checkout, or exit the program.

Input Validation: Ensures that prices and quantities are numeric and non-negative, handling invalid input gracefully.

Implementation Details:

Uses Python dictionaries to store items, their prices, and quantities.

Employs functions to modularize the code, including adding items and displaying the cart.

Utilizes decision constructs to validate inputs and manage program flow.

Implements looping constructs to allow continuous user interaction until checkout or exit.

Makes use of f-strings for clear and readable output formatting.

Purpose:

This application demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts such as collections, loops, conditional statements, and functions, while simulating a practical shopping cart scenario. It is ideal for showcasing programming skills in console-based application development, input handling, and data management.
